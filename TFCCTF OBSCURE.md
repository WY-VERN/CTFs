so as you can see for this one you can't do much it's just a sanity check like literally 
i mean you could find some tool to enhacnce and separate the content of the image but honestely i haven't gone this far 
so i just let the task for my tired eyes
so i looked deep in the text and bang the flag is there don't you see it maybe you need your glasses go bring em 

anyway after 3 tries i found the flag :

flag:**TCFCTF{s3cur1ty_thr0ugh_0bscur1ty}**


and that's it
